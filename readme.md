# Actually i'll throw all the notes in this readme file. It'll be easy to look at the notes from people during the project. You don't HAVE to use it but it could be useful identifying parts of the code and detailing what changes were made.

# If you make a mistake and need help, also put some info here if it helps and i'll check it to see if I can help in any way.

# Good luck team :)
