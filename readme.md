# Actually i'll throw all the notes in this readme file. It'll be easy to look at the notes from people during the project. You don't HAVE to use it but it could be useful identifying parts of the code and detailing what changes were made.

# If you make a mistake and need help, also put some info here if it helps and i'll check it to see if I can help in any way.

# I actually think you may have to push to get your work onto github. Was just checking out jonas' video git in a group and I think this is the right way to work

# Good luck team :)
